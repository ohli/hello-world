hello-world
===========

My first repo

## Things I expect from github:
* nice distributed CVS
* Wiki features
* issue driven progress
* student discount

## Who am I?
No robot, as you might have guessed :-)
I'm a student off business information systems at HfT Leipzig.

I should learn how to get into branching
